# lara-x

A tool designed to generate a Laravel application baseline, offering pre-built management features that save time on foundational setup. This allows developers to jumpstart their projects, focusing on custom code and specific functionalities, rather than building standard management tools from scratch. Itâ€™s ideal for accelerating development without sacrificing flexibility for further customization.
